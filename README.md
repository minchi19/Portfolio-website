# Portfolio-website

This repo contains an easy-to-customize personal website portfolio template that was created with HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
It is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the Bootstrap grid system and loaded with Font Awesome. 
The site is static and comes production ready if you just want to add your information and go.
Alternatively, you can edit styles, colours, and scripts fairly easily.
The site was built as modular as possible to make it easy to shift around styles and content.

# Making Edits / Customizing the Template

To setup, simply fork the repo and use it.

## Using The Template As Is
If you wish to use the template as is (i.e. how it's seen in the demo), 
then all that's required is the css, images, js, libs folders inside assets folder and the index.html file.
You would then add your content to index.html as needed and you're good to go.

## Images
By default, the template comes with a number of images, some of which can be kept and others which act simply as placeholders
and should be switched. The template contains the following:
- Favicon (/favicon.ico) - this is the favicon used for the page. 
Similar to the main bg, this can kept or changed easily by replacing the favicon.ico with your new one.

- Background image, This image is the main background image for website which can be found under ```assets\images\background.jpg``` to change it.

- Other images - All other images used in website is under ``` assets\images ``` folder.
